## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS (styles/style.scss)
- JS + Jquery (end up using mainly JS, since it was used a plugin for the Countdown)
- flip.js - a flip countdown plugin used to build the main component of the screen


### Useful resources

- [Tick documentation](https://pqina.nl/tick/) - tick element information
- [Git Hub source for Flip Countdown](https://github.com/pqina/flip/) - information on how to use the countdown.
